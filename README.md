# HTML5 Canvas Tic-Tac-Toe

Here is a simple game of tic-tac-toe developed by me using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The code features a class named TicTacToe which is used to manage the current state of the game created by the constructor. Furthermore, this class has methods which implements the core functionality of the game as well as the drawing features via HTML5 canvas.

## How to Play

1. Player 1 goes first by placing an X anywhere on the 3x3 grid.
2. Player 2 goes second by placing an O in a valid spot on the 3x3 grid.
3. Steps 1-2 are repeated until the game detects a winner. To win, a player must get 3 of his or her marks in a row either across, vertically, or diagonally. If a win is not detected, then the game ends in a draw.
4. Click on play again to restart the game.

## Ideas for future commits

1. Implement artificial intelligence 
2. Implement a 4x4 grid or larger
3. Implement unique artwork and sounds
